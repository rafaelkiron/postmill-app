# Production all-in-one image — multi-stage, non-root.
#
# One container runs the whole app: nginx fronts it on :5000, routing /api/* to
# the NestJS backend (127.0.0.1:3000, /api prefix stripped), /uploads/* to the
# uploads volume, and everything else to the Next.js frontend prod server
# (127.0.0.1:4200). The three processes are spawned by docker/entrypoint.sh
# (plain bash `&` + `wait -n` + signal trap — deliberately no PM2; if any
# process dies the entrypoint exits and the orchestrator restarts the
# container). This matches the contract of the root docker-compose.yaml, which
# publishes 4007:5000 and points the browser at NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
# http://localhost:4007/api.
#
# Differs from docker/Dockerfile.dev (which bundled devDeps + ran nginx + PM2 as
# root): this builds in a throwaway stage, prunes dev dependencies, and the
# runtime stage runs as an unprivileged user.
#
# Build:  docker build -f Dockerfile -t postmill-app .
# Run:    docker run -p 4007:5000 --env-file .env postmill-app
# (docker/Containerfile.render remains the separate Podman video-render worker.)
